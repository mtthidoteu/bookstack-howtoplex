# Introduction
I created a small BookStack Wiki intended to easily explain how to Install, Create an Account, and request Movies on Plex (Using overseerr as a request Software). Feel free to use!

# How to use/import.
Unfortunately Bookstack doesn't have a way of properly "exporting/importing" books/pages. So prepare for a little of copying and pasting.

 1. Run a Bookstack Instance (Lazy? I've put my Docker-compose file in the repo).
 2. Download HTML File From Repo and Run in Browser (easier)
 3. Create a new book named whatever you want ("Plex Server Instructions" for example)
 4. Create two new chapters
     - First Time Setup
     - Adding Movies & Setup
 5. Create 5 Pages
	 - 4 Pages in "First Time Setup"
		 - Creating a Plex Account
		 - Joining the Plex Server
		 - Downloading the Plex Client
		 - Important! Setting up the Plex App.
	 - 1 Page in "Adding Movies & TV shows" 
		 - Adding Movies & TV Shows
5. Copy Content of each page into newly created pages.
6. Modify Each Page to your desire.
